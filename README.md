RFID/NFC based band scanner.
The involvement of people in record keeping for attendance can prove to be inefficient. Identification of individuals for entry into college premises can prove to be a tough task that is often ignored. We wish to tackle this issue with the introduction of NFC wristbands or ID cards, which each student will wear, get themselves scanned at the entrance, and thereby digitally record their presence in the college. We hope to also include the concept of money storage on these bands for the canteen and parking systems.
